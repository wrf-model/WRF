# Instructing GitHub to exlude all files from auto-generated release tar/zip-balls.
# These auto-generated release files are incomplete - lacking git submodule contents.
# It is not possible to disable these auto-generated release files, hence at least
# forcing them to be empty to avoid disseminating incomplete tarballs.
# Archives with git submodule contents included are generated by CI workflow and are
# available alongside the auto-generated (emtpy) files on GitHub.
