# Instructing GitHub to exclude all files from auto-generated release tar/zip-balls.
# These auto-generated release files are incomplete - lacking git submodule contents.
# It is not possible to disable these auto-generated release files, hence at least
# forcing them to be empty to avoid disseminating incomplete tarballs. Archives with 
# git submodule contents included are available (alongside the empty tar/zip-balls) at:
# https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF/releases
