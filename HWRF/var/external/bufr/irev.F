C ABSTRACT: THIS FUNCTION WILL, WHEN THE LOCAL MACHINE IS "LITTLE-
C   ENDIAN" (I.E., USES A RIGHT TO LEFT SCHEME FOR NUMBERING THE BYTES
C   WITHIN A MACHINE WORD), RETURN A COPY OF AN INPUT INTEGER WORD WITH
C   THE BYTES REVERSED.  ALTHOUGH, BY DEFINITION (WITHIN WMO MANUAL
C   306), A BUFR MESSAGE IS A STREAM OF INDIVIDUAL OCTETS (I.E., BYTES)
C   THAT IS INDEPENDENT OF ANY PARTICULAR MACHINE REPRESENTATION, THE
C   BUFR ARCHIVE LIBRARY SOFTWARE OFTEN NEEDS TO INTERPRET ALL OR PARTS
C   OF TWO OR MORE ADJACENT BYTES IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT AN INTEGER
C   WORD.  BY DEFAULT, THE SOFTWARE USES THE "BIG-ENDIAN" (LEFT TO
C   RIGHT) SCHEME FOR NUMBERING BYTES.  BY REVERSING THE BYTES, IREV
C   ALLOWS THE INTEGER WORD TO BE PROPERLY READ OR WRITTEN (DEPENDING
C   ON WHETHER INPUT OR OUTPUT OPERATIONS, RESPECTIVELY, ARE BEING
C   PERFORMED) ON LITTLE-ENDIAN MACHINES.  IF THE LOCAL MACHINE IS
C   BIG-ENDIAN, IREV SIMPLY RETURNS A COPY OF THE SAME INTEGER THAT WAS
C   INPUT.

C USAGE:    IREV (N)
C   INPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     N        - INTEGER: INTEGER WORD WITH BYTES ORDERED ACCORDING TO
C                THE "BIG-ENDIAN" NUMBERING SCHEME
C
C   OUTPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C     IREV     - INTEGER: INTEGER WORD WITH BYTES ORDERED ACCORDING TO
C                THE NUMBERING SCHEME OF THE LOCAL MACHINE (EITHER
C                "BIG-ENDIAN" OR "LITTLE-ENDIAN", IF "BIG-ENDIAN THEN
C                THIS IS JUST A DIRECT COPY OF N)
