How to compile and run?
-----------------------

- In WRF directory, type 'configure' - this will create a configure.wrf
  file that has appropriate compile options for the supported computers.

  Note: WRF requires netCDF library. If your netCDF library is installed in
        some odd directory, set environment variable NETCDF before you type
        'configure'. For example, 

        setenv NETCDF /usr/local/netcdf-pgi

- Type 'compile case_name' where you can find the case_names by simply typing
  compile. The following are available:

      compile em_b_wave
      compile em_grav2d_x
      compile em_heldsuarez
      compile em_hill2d_x
      compile em_les
      compile em_quarter_ss
      compile em_real
      compile em_seabreeze2d_x
      compile em_convrad
      compile em_squall2d_x
      compile em_squall2d_y
      compile em_scm_xy
      compile em_tropical_cyclone

  Notes: 1. If you are going to create model output file that is more than 2Gb,
      you should consider using netCDF large file support function. To activate
      this, one must set the environment variable WRFIO_NCD_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT.
      In c-shell environment, do

      setenv WRFIO_NCD_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT 1

      This becomes default since V3.9.

      2. Since V3.2, we support using multiple processors for compilation. The
      default number of processors used is 2. But if you have any problem with
      compilation, please try using one processor to compile. To do this, set
      the following environment variable before compile:

      setenv J "-j 1"

- If sucessful, this will create either real.exe or ideal.exe and wrf.exe
  in directory main/, and the appropriate executables will be linked into
  the test directoires under test/case_name, or run/.

- cd to the appropriate test or run directory to run ideal/real/wrf.

- If it is one of the idealized cases (b_wave, hill2d_x, grav2d_x, quarter_ss,
  squall2d_x, squall2d_y, em_les or em_heldsuarez), cd the the appropriate directory, type

  ./ideal.exe 

  to produce wrfinput_d01 file for wrf model. Then type

  ./wrf.exe 

  to run. 

- If it is real-data case (real), place files from WPS (met_em.*)
  in the appropriate directory, type

  ./real.exe

  to produce wrfbdy_d01 and wrfinput_d01. Then type

  ./wrf.exe

  to run.

- If you use mpich, type

  mpirun -np number-of-processors wrf.exe
