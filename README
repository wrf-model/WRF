release of WRF and consider WRF to be in the public domain for
use by any person or entity for any purpose without any fee or

V2 Release Notes:
-----------------

This is the main directory for the WRF Version 2 source code release.

- For directions on compiling WRF, see below or Users Web page.
- For more information on WRF V2 release, visit WRF Users home page
  http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/
- If you have used WRF software before, you must rerun SI (set 
  namelist variable OUTPUT_FILE_TYPE = 'WRF') preferrably using
  the new SI V2.0 release (www.wrf-model.org/si).
  wrfbdy_d01/wrfinput_d01 from 1.3 release will not work for V2 WRF model.
- WRF V2's namelist has changed significantly. Read the README.namelist
  file in the run/ directory (or on the Users' page), and make changes 
  carefully.

For questions, send mail to wrfhelp@ucar.edu

V2 update history:

- V2.0.1: May 21, 2004
- V2.0.2: June 3, 2004
- V2.0.3: Nov 12, 2004 
  V2.0.3.1: Dec 3, 2004

======================================

How to compile and run?
-----------------------

- In WRFV2 directory, type 'configure' - this will create a configure.wrf
  file that has appropriate compile options for the supported computers.

  Note: WRF requires netCDF library. If your netCDF library is installed in
        some odd directory, set environment variable NETCDF before you type
        'configure'. For example, 

        setenv NETCDF /usr/local/lib32/r4i4

- Type 'compile case_name' where you can find the case_names by simply typing
  compile. The following are available:

        compile em_b_wave
        compile em_hill2d_x
        compile em_grav2d_x
        compile em_quarter_ss
        compile em_real
        compile em_squall2d_x
        compile em_squall2d_y

- If sucessfully, this will create either real.exe or ideal.exe and wrf.exe
  in directory main/, and the appropriate executables will be linked into
  the test directoires under test/case_name, or run/.

- cd to the appropriate test or run direcotry to run ideal/real/wrf.

- If it is one of the idealized cases (b_wave, hill2d_x, grav2d_x, quarter_ss,
  squall2d_x or squall2d_y), cd the the appropriate directory, type

  ideal.exe 

  to produce wrfinput_d01 file for wrf model. Then type

  wrf.exe 

  to run. 

- If it is real-data case (real), place files from SI (wrf_real_input_em.*)
  in the appropriate directory, type

  real.exe

  to produce wrfbdy_d01 and wrfinput_d01. Then type

  wrf.exe

  to run.

- If you use mpich, type

  mpirun -np number-of-processors wrf.exe

======================================

What is in WRF V2?

- Advanced Research WRF (ARW) core: Eulerian mass, hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic
  * Arakawa C-grid staggering
  * Runge-Kutta 2nd and 3rd order timestep options
  * scalar-conserving flux form for prognostic variables
  * 2nd to 6th order advection options (horizontal and vertical)
  * time-split small step for acoustic modes
  * small step horizontally explicit, vertically implicit
  * divergence damping option and vertical time off-centering
  * external-mode filtering option for mass model
  * hydrostatic option via namelist option

- Two-way nesting:
  * multiple domains and multiple nest levels
  * supports integer nest grid ratio
  * feedback option for both odd and even nest grid ratios (since 2.0.3)
  * smoothing options

- One-way nesting (since 2.0.2)

- Physics options:
  * microphysics (Kessler/ WRF Single Moment 3, 5 and 6 class / Lin et al./
    Eta Ferrier)
  * cumulus parameterization (Kain-Fritsch with shallow convection / 
    Betts-Miller-Janjic / Grell-Devenyi ensemble)
  * planetary boundary layer (Yosei University (S. Korea) / Mellor-Yamada-Janjic)
  * surface layer (similarity theory MM5 / Eta)
  * slab soil model (5-layer thermal diffusion / Noah land-surface model (4-level) /
    RUC LSM (6-level) )
  * longwave radiation (RRTM)
  * shortwave radiation (simple MM5 scheme / Goddard)
  * sub-grid turbulence (constant K diffusion/ Smagorinsky/ predicted TKE)
  * land-use categories determine surface properties

- Sofeware

  * Hierarchical software architecture that insulates scientific code
    (Model Layer) from computer architecture (Driver Layer)
  * Multi-level parallelism supporting shared-memory (OpenMP), distributed-memory (MPI), 
    and hybrid share/distributed modes of execution
  * Active data registry: defines and manages model state fields, I/O,
    nesting, configuration, and numerous other aspects of WRF through a single file, 
    called the Registry
  * Two-way nesting:
      Easy to extend: forcing and feedback of new fields specified by
        editing a single table in the Registry
      Efficient: 5-8% overhead on 64 processes of IBM
  * Enhanced I/O options:
      NetCDF and Parallel HDF5 formats
      Five auxiliary history output streams separately controllable through the namelist
      Output file names and time-stamps specifiable through namelist
      Special output stream for 3DVAR
  * Efficient execution on a range of computing platforms:
      IBM SP systems, (e.g. NCAR "bluesky" Power4-based system)
      HP/Compaq Alpha/OSF workstation, SMP, and MPP systems (e.g. Pittsburgh 
         Supercomputing Center TCS)
      SGI Origin and Altix
      Linux/Intel
         IA64 MPP (HP Superdome, SGI Altix, NCSA Teragrid systems)
         IA64 SMP
         Pentium 3/4 SMP and SMP clusters (NOAA/FSL iJet system)
	 PGI and Intel compilers supported
      Alpha Linux (NOAA/FSL Jet system)
      Sun Solaris (single threaded and SMP)
      Cray X1
      HP-UX
      Other ports under development:
         NEC SX/6
         Fujitsu VPP 5000
  * RSL_LITE: optional new communication layer, scalable to very
    large domains (limited to single domain in 2.0)
  * ESMF Time Management, including exact arithmetic for fractional
    time steps (no drift); model start, stop, run length and I/O frequencies are
    now specified as times and time intervals in 2.0 (rather than numbers of
    steps, as in 1.3 and earlier)
  * Improved documentation, both on-line (web based browsing tools) and in-line
