NCEP BUFR tables used in reading AIRS radiance data.
  gmao_airs_bufr.tbl:     
     used for reading NCEP center/warmest/every-FOV AIRS BUFR files

radiance_info/*.info
  Used for (1) switching on/off certain channels (2) assigning obs errors
  Currently, only the 4th and 6th columns in each file are actually used.
  4th column info: 1: use
                  -1: not use
  6th colum info: observation errors in K

VARBC.in
  Template input file for radiance Variational Bias Correction.

be.dat.cv3
  Background error covariance file for cv_options=3.

crtm_coeffs_2.1.3
   only a subset of coefficient files are included in the crtm_coeffs_2.1.3 directory.
   The full set of coefficient files can be downloaded from
   ftp://ftp.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/jcsda/CRTM/REL-2.1.3/REL-2.1.3.CRTM.tar.gz
   Some CRTM algorithms (Multiple transmittance algorithm, infrared sea surface 
   emissivity model) are selectable by users via the coefficient files used to
   initialize CRTM. Users should gather the coefficient files that are suitable 
   for their applications. Please read the CRTM USers Guide
   ftp://ftp.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/jcsda/CRTM/REL-2.1.3/REL-2.1.3.CRTM_User_Guide.pdf
   for more detailed information.

fso.io_config and plus.io_config
   input file for WRF FSO runtime config of I/O streams
