   is one and then allocates a new one that is big enough.  If RSL_FREEBUF
   is called for a P, the two buffers (send and recv) are truncated and
   freed and NULL is returned.

   You are guaranteed to get back the same buffer as the previous call
   for a given P, as long as the size is less than the size passed to
   the previous call.  Thus, you can use this routine to manage the
   pointers to the buffers for P and avoid having to set up arrays
   of pointers in the routines that use these buffers.
