#               shared libraries upon which it depends.  DEP_LIBS should
#               contain -L<dir> tokens to specify where the dependent 
#               libraries are, and -l<lib> tokens to specify libraries to link.
#    OBJS     - List of object files that go into the library.

#  1. Be careful about whitespace after the last character in the LIB_NAME.
#     These spaces will generate an error when the library is made.
