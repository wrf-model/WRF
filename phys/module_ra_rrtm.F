!  This program calculates the upward fluxes, downward fluxes, and               
!  heating rates for an arbitrary clear or cloudy atmosphere.  The input         
!  to this program is the atmospheric profile, all Planck function               
!  information, and the cloud fraction by layer.  The diffusivity angle          
!  (SECANG=1.66) is used for the angle integration for consistency with          
!  the NCAR CCM; the Gaussian weight appropriate to this angle (WTNUM=0.5)       
!  is applied here.  Note that use of the emissivity angle for the flux          
!  integration can cause errors of 1 to 4 W/m2 within cloudy layers.

!  This routine calculates the gaseous optical depths for all 16 longwave        
!  spectral bands.  The optical depths are used to define the Pade               
!  approximation to the function of tau transition from tranparancy to           
!  opacity.  This function, which varies from 0 to 1, is converted to an         
!  integer that will serve as an index for the lookup tables of tau              
!  transition function and transmittance used in the radiative transfer.         
!  These lookup tables are created on initialization in routine RRTMINIT.
