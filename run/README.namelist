Description of namelist variables

---------------------------------
 
 Note: variables followed by (max_dom) indicate that this variable needs to
       be defined for the nests when max_dom > 1.

 &time_control
 run_days                            = 0,	! run time in days
 run_hours                           = 0,	! run time in hours
                                                  Note: if it is more than 1 day, one may use both run_days and run_hours
                                                  or just run_hours. e.g. if the total run length is 36 hrs, you may
                                                  set run_days = 1, and run_hours = 12, or run_days = 0, and run_hours = 36.
 run_minutes                         = 0,	! run time in minutes
 run_seconds                         = 0,	! run time in seconds
 start_year (max_dom)                = 2001,	! four digit year of starting time
 start_month (max_dom)               = 06,	! two digit month of starting time
 start_day (max_dom)                 = 11,	! two digit day of starting time
 start_hour (max_dom)                = 12,	! two digit hour of starting time
 start_minute (max_dom)              = 00,	! two digit minute of starting time
 start_second (max_dom)              = 00,	! two digit second of starting time
                                                  Note: the start time is used to name the first wrfout file.
                                                  It also controls the start time for nest domains, and the time to restart
 end_year (max_dom)                  = 2001,	! four digit year of ending time
 end_month (max_dom)                 = 06,	! two digit month of ending time
 end_day (max_dom)                   = 12,	! two digit day of ending time
 end_hour (max_dom)                  = 12,	! two digit hour of ending time
 end_minute (max_dom)                = 00,	! two digit minute of ending time
 end_second (max_dom)                = 00,	! two digit second of ending time
                                                  It also controls when the nest domain integrations end
                                                  All start and end times are used by real.exe.

                                                  Note that one may use either run_days/run_hours etc. or 
                                                  end_year/month/day/hour etc. to control the length of 
                                                  model integration. But run_days/run_hours
                                                  takes precedence over the end times. 
                                                  Program real.exe uses start and end times only.

                                     = "wrf_real_input_em.d<domain>.<date>"  ! Input to real from SI

Other output options: Note all auxhist[1-24], auxinput[2-24] interval variables are domain dependent

                                                    auxhist9_d<domain>_<date> will be used
                                                    also note that to write variables in output other
                                                    than the history file requires Registry.EM file change

                                                  Note: do restart only at multiple of auxhist3_intervals

For observation nudging:
 auxinput11_interval                 = 10       ! interval in minutes for observation data. It should be 
                                                  set as or more frequently as obs_ionf (with unit of 
                                                  coarse domain time step).
 auxinput11_end_h                    = 6        ! end of observation time in hours.

Options for run-time IO:

 iofields_filename (max_dom)         = "my_iofields_list.txt",
                                       (example: +:h:21:rainc, rainnc, rthcuten)
 ignore_iofields_warning             = .true.,  ! what to do when encountering an error in the user-specified files
                                       .false., ! abort when encountering an error in iofields_filename file

                                                  starting from hour 3 to hour 12 in 180 min interval.

For automatic moving nests: requires special input data, and environment variable TERRAIN_AND_LANDUSE set at compile time
                                     (This option will overwrite input_from_file for nest domains)
 input_from_hires (max_dom)          = .true., 
 rsmas_data_path                     = "path-to-terrain-and-landuse-dataset"

 &domains
 time_step                           = 60,	! time step for integration in integer seconds
                                                  recommend 6*dx (in km) for typical real-data cases

                                                  vertical dimensions need to be the same for all nests
                                                  Note: most variables are unstaggered (= staggered dim - 1)

Users may explicitly define full eta levels.  Given are two distributions for 28 and 35 levels.  The number
of levels must agree with the number of eta surfaces allocated (e_vert).  Users may alternatively request 
only the number of levels (with e_vert), and the real program will compute values. There are
two methods selected with auto_levels_opt = 1 (old) or 2 (new). The old computation assumes
a known first several layers, then generates equi-height spaced levels up to the top of the model.
The new method has surface and upper stretching factors (dz_stretch_s and dz_stretch_u) to stretch levels according to
log p up to where it reaches the maximum thickness (max_dz) and starting from thickness dzbot.
The stretching transitions from dzstretch_s to dzstretch_u by the time the thickness reaches max_dz/2.

Horizontal interpolation options, coarse grid to fine grid.  The default is to use
the Smolarkiewicz "SINT" method.  However, this is known to break with the 
implementation inside of WRF for large refinement ratios (such as 15:1).  For those
extreme (and quite rare occurrences), other schemes are available.  For options
1, 3, 4, and 12, the FG lateral boundaries use the same horizontal scheme for the
lateral BC computations.

Variables specifically for the 3d ocean initialization with a single profile. Set
the ocean physics option to #2.  Specify a number of levels.  For each of those levels,
provide a depth (m) below the surface.  At each depth provide a temperature (K) and
a salinity (ppt).  The default is not to use the 3d ocean.  Even when the 3d ocean is
activated, the user must specify a reasonable ocean.  Currently, this is the only way
available to run the 3d ocean option.

By default the pressure and height level data goes into stream 23 and 22, respectively. Using
the vertical interpolation options requires the user to define an io_form and interval for
the requested stream.  See examples.namelist.

Add an extra set of 3d arrays for vertical interpolation to the
processing for the real program.  Typically, this extra data set
is to include monthly aerosol data.  The vertical coordinate of the
aerosol data is able to be separate from the input meteorological
data.  To introduce new data sets, mods are required in the Registry
and in module_initialize_real.F.  There is a space-holder/practice
set-up for "GCA".  The actual data set for Thompson mp=28 (WIF) that 
utilizes QNWFA and QNIFA (water and ice friendly aerosols) has 
been tested.

 wif_input_opt                       = 1

physics suite specification, which specifies physics options 

 mp_physics
 cu_physics
 ra_lw_physics
 ra_sw_physics
 bl_pbl_physics
 sf_sfclay_physics
 sf_surface_physics

with a new namelist physics_suite = 'X'. Two suites are available:

 physics_suite = 'CONUS'

 or 

 physics_suite = 'tropical'

where 'CONUS' is equivalent to

 mp_physics         = 8,
 cu_physics         = 6,
 ra_lw_physics      = 4,
 ra_sw_physics      = 4,
 bl_pbl_physics     = 2,
 sf_sfclay_physics  = 2,
 sf_surface_physics = 2,

and 'tropical' is equivalent to

 mp_physics         = 6,
 cu_physics         = 16,
 ra_lw_physics      = 4,
 ra_sw_physics      = 4,
 bl_pbl_physics     = 1,
 sf_sfclay_physics  = 91,
 sf_surface_physics = 2,

One can use physics_suite, and overwrite one or more options by explicitly including the physics 
namelists.

To overwrite an option for a nest, one can have

 &physics
 physics_suite                       = 'tropical'
 cu_physics                          = -1,    -1,     0,
 ...

here '-1' means to use option specified by the suite, and '0' modifies the cumulus option from the 
suite option 16 to 0 (turning cumulus off).

Traditional / full fields model output

The WRF model output may be modified at run-time to also include a stream that contains
more traditional fields: temperature, pressure, geopotential height, etc. The flag needs to 
be activated in the namelist (diag_nwp2 = 1). In the registry.trad_fields, the output stream 
is "h1", so that stream needs to be explicitly requested in the namelist.input file.

Solar diagnostics output

For solar diagnostics, 2-D fields of variables relevant to solar forecasting are output
when option solar_diagnostics is activated in diags section of namelist, as shown below.
Also, if tslist is present when solar_diagnostics is activated, then these same variables
are output to the time series files for the location(s) specified in tslist (see README.tslist).
All variables are calculated in phys/module_diag_solar.F and defined in registry.solar_fields

 &diags
 solar_diagnostics                   =  1
