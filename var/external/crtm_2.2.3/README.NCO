CRTM v2.2.3 Build Instructions for NCO 
======================================

$Revision: 60152 $


The included script, "make_crtm_lib.sh", can be used by NCO SPAs to configure,
build, and install the CRTM library on WCOSS (or zeus) by typing:

  $ make_crtm_lib.sh ifort.setup

This will:

  1. Build the CRTM library using the Intel ifort compiler.
  2. Install the CRTM library *in the build directory* in the structure required
     by NCO for use in /nwprod/lib.

The created installation directory can then be moved by NCO SPAs to its final
or testing location (/nwprod/lib or /nwpara/lib) as required.

If there are any questions or problems (or suggestions to make this even easier)
don't hesistate to contact me at paul.vandelst@noaa.gov.

Full-blown configuration, build, check, and install instructions are available
in the README file.
